## About the project

**Restaurant Reviews** is a project with Udacity and Google Scholarship program for the FEND Track. A maps component is used for displaying the restaurant locations daily around New York City. It has been developed to be accessible for screen readers and fully responsive on different sized displays. There is also a service worker employed to offer a seamless offline experience for users.

## How to Run Application

**Run it on your local machine:
* download or clone the repository
* next follow these [instructions](#instructions)

### Instructions
**Running application on local machine**

To get started: 

* Terminal into the project's folder and start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) 

* For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

* Note - For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as python by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter python -m http.server 8000.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:3000` if not open automatically
